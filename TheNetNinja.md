##  A Birdseye View of GraphQL

* REST API endpoints use urls to control different types of data
* FE makes AJAX/fetch requests to endpoints to retrieve information
* So you retrieve your information based on resources, one bye one based on endpoints

Graphql you retrieve information based on a graphql so you can go to a node and retrieve information but since they are connected then you an retrieve other types of information available on the same call.
