* apollo-server-express: wrapper with utils; 
* * ex. grahpqlExpress for app route and exposing http

Describe data to be exposed by our API
* typeDefs: top level type
* * which queries can be sent by the client

ex. All a client can do is ask fo the greeting that returns a string value
```js
type Query {
 greeting: String
}
```

* Resolvers: process a request
  - it resolves the value of a field in this case greeting
